                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned
                    were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I 
                    honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

                    transition and have some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredible fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks 
                    were the best - and most gruelling-  the time of my life. Since completing the course, i've 
                    successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                    "Before joing the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structures from professionals who can 
                    help me lean programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll byu a former student of theirs who can only say 
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. they were very hands-on and 
                    i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding, it took my learning, 
                    it took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during
                    interviews as a n example of my developed experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after 
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended! "
